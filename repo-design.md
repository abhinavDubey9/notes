### Standard Repository Layout
Regardless of the language or framework you're using, having a well-organized repository structure is important. A typical repository structure might look like this:

1. ### Monorepo Repository Design for Mend Integration
Use Case:
Scenario: Large-scale organizations or teams managing multiple interrelated projects, libraries, or microservices in a single repository.
Reasoning: Centralized control of dependencies, shared libraries, and infrastructure across multiple projects, making management easier.

### Repository Structure:

## Challenges:

### Large Scan Times:
 Scanning a monorepo can take more time due to the sheer number of services and dependencies.

### Conflicting Dependency Versions:
 Services within the same repo may rely on different versions of the same library, which could introduce vulnerability management complexity.

### Best Practice:
Use conditional scanning or partial scans in Mend to avoid rescanning the entire repository every time (e.g., only scan modified folders in pull requests).

2. ### Polyrepo Repository Design for Mend Integration
Use Case:
Scenario: Distributed microservices architecture where each service is independently managed and deployed. Each repository corresponds to a single service or project.
Reasoning: Clear separation of concerns, independent deployments, and isolated dependencies for each service.

### Key Design Elements:
#### Independent Repositories:
 Each service (e.g., service-a, service-b) has its own dedicated repository. Dependencies are isolated, making management easier.
#### Shared Library Repository: 
Shared libraries are managed in their own repo (e.g., shared-lib-repo) and can be versioned independently.

### Benefits:
#### Modular Security Scans:
 Each repository can be scanned separately, ensuring that vulnerabilities are tracked at a granular level.
#### Faster Scans:
 Smaller repositories lead to faster Mend scans, as each scan is limited to the dependencies of a specific service or library.
#### Granular Policy Management:
 Each service can have its own security policies and vulnerability thresholds.

### Challenges:
#### Version Management: 
Shared libraries may become a source of vulnerabilities if not updated consistently across all services.
#### Multiple Configuration Files:
 Each repository requires its own Mend configuration, leading to management overhead.

### Best Practice:
Automated Dependency Updates: Use tools like Renovate or Dependabot to automate dependency updates across polyrepos. This ensures that vulnerabilities in shared libraries are promptly fixed in consuming services.


## Steps to Enable Mend to Handle Multiple requirements.txt Files in a Monorepo
- Define the Path to Each requirements.txt in the Mend Configuration
  ![alt text](image-3.png)

- Create a .whitesource or .mend.yml Configuration File
  In the root of your monorepo, create a .whitesource or .mend.yml file. Within this file, you will define each service's requirements.txt file, specifying where to find them.

    Example .whitesource or .mend.yml:

- Mend Scanning Behavior for Monorepos
  - #### Dependency Aggregation:
      Mend will scan each requirements.txt file as a separate project within the same monorepo. It will analyze all dependencies and produce individual reports per service.
  - #### Combined Reporting:
    You can combine the reports for an overall monorepo view, or keep them separate for individual service tracking. Mend’s reporting tools allow you to filter by project.

- Alternative: Use Custom Scripts to Aggregate Dependencies

If you don’t want Mend to handle multiple files individually, you could write a custom script that:
Aggregates all the dependencies from multiple requirements.txt files into a single file (e.g., combined-requirements.txt).
You could then configure Mend to scan this aggregated file.

### Monorepo Advantages and Disadvantages:
**Advantages:**

1) Single Dependency Management: Easier to scan all dependencies in one place with Mend, providing a consolidated view of security vulnerabilities.
2) Unified Security Reports: Mend can generate a comprehensive report across all projects, simplifying security tracking.
3) Consistent Code Quality Enforcement: SonarCloud quality gates and rules can be applied uniformly across services, ensuring consistent code quality standards.
4) Shared Libraries Analysis: Both Mend and SonarCloud can analyze shared libraries across services in the same repository.
5) Single CI/CD Pipeline: A single CI/CD pipeline can trigger both Mend and SonarCloud scans, streamlining integration and maintenance.

**Disadvantages:**

1) Multiple requirements.txt or config files complexity: Handling multiple dependency files (like requirements.txt, pom.xml) within the same repo can make dependency tracking and scans challenging for Mend.
2) Longer Scans: A large monorepo with multiple services may result in longer scanning times for both Mend (for dependencies) and SonarCloud (for code analysis).
3) Complex CI/CD Configuration: The CI/CD pipeline setup for both tools can become complex due to the need for unique configurations for each service (like individual sonar-project.properties for SonarCloud).
4) Scaling Challenges: As the monorepo grows, it becomes harder to scale and manage multiple services, especially for large systems with numerous dependencies and codebases.

### Polyrepo: Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

1) Isolated Dependency Management: Each repository can manage its own dependencies, making it easier for Mend to scan and report on vulnerabilities specific to each project.
2) Granular Security Reports: Mend provides security reports per repository, giving clear insights into each project's vulnerabilities.
3) Tailored Code Quality Control: SonarCloud allows individual quality gates and rules for each repository, providing flexibility in applying different standards for different projects.
4) Simplified Project Structure: Each repository has a clean and focused structure, reducing complexity in both Mend and SonarCloud configurations.
5) Easier to Scale: Polyrepos allow for better scalability, as individual projects can grow and evolve independently with their own configurations and tool integrations.

**Disadvantages:**

1) Management Overhead: Each repository requires a separate setup for both Mend and SonarCloud, which increases the administrative overhead, especially with a large number of repositories.
2) Duplicate Efforts for Shared Libraries: Shared code or libraries need to be scanned and analyzed separately across repositories, which can lead to redundant work in both Mend and SonarCloud.
3) Multiple CI/CD Pipelines: Each repository needs its own CI/CD pipeline, which increases the complexity of maintaining multiple pipelines for tool integration.
Cross-Project Dependencies: Dependencies shared between projects across different repositories can be difficult to manage and track consistently.
